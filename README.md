## Project Management and Development Approach:

This project was implemented using the Agile Manifesto methodology. Below are the ways this project adhered to the 4 core values and 12 core principles of the aforementioned method:

<strong>Four Values of the Agile Manifesto:</strong>

- Vision 1: Customer collaboration over contract negotiation: I worked with four(4) cohort mates who are my imaginary customers. We held **10** meetings through Google Meet Platform, ensuring alignment with user needs and prioritizing features through user story mapping.
<br>

- Vision 2: Responding to change over following a plan: Throughout the project, I managed
  [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/IkennaEgwim/Expenso)](https://github.com/IkennaEgwim/Expenso/issues) + [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/IkennaEgwim/Expenso)](https://github.com/IkennaEgwim/Expenso/issues) GitHub issues, adapting to changing requirements and feedback iteratively. 
<br>

- Vision 3: Working software over comprehensive documentation: I achieved **15 story points** across **1 sprint**, emphasizing the focus on delivering functional software increments.

## Database Design:

![ERD](./expenso_app/static/readme_img/features/model%20databases.png)


Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help the developer to make connections between databases and information. Creating an ERD helped me understand how the tables relate to one another. I used LucidChart to create the diagram and the arrow represent how the data fields relate to one another.


## Data Models:


| User   |            |   |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| id |  Autofield |  PK|
| username |  CharField   |   FK |
| email | EmailField |     |
| password |  CharField | FK |




| Expense   |            |   |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
|id |  Autofield |  PK |
| user |  CharField   |   FK |
| amount |  DecimalField   |    |
| description | CharField |    |
| date |  DateTimeField   |    |
| category |  CharField | FK |

| Category   |            |   |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
|id |  Autofield |  PK |
| user |  CharField   |   FK |
| name |  CharField   |    |


| Budget  |            |   |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
|id |  Autofield |  PK |
| user |  CharField   |   FK |
| category |  CharField | FK  |
| amount |  DecimalField  |    |
| month |  CharField  |    |




## User Flow Chart:
![Expenso Flowchart](./expenso_app/static/images/flow_chart.png)



The Flowchart served as an efficient way to make important decisions when creating the app. It helped me narrow down which decisions were important for the users and admin as well as establishing the appropriate authentication. It also helped me decide which features were the most important.
