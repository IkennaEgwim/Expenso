## Project Management and Development Approach:

This project was implemented using the Agile Manifesto methodology. Below are the ways this project adhered to the 4 core values and 12 core principles of the aforementioned method:

<strong>Four Values of the Agile Manifesto:</strong>

- Vision 1: Customer collaboration over contract negotiation: I worked with four(4) cohort mates who are my imaginary customers. We held **10** meetings through Google Meet Platform, ensuring alignment with user needs and prioritizing features through user story mapping.
<br>

- Vision 2: Responding to change over following a plan: Throughout the project, I managed
  [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/IkennaEgwim/Expenso)](https://github.com/IkennaEgwim/Expenso/issues) + [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/IkennaEgwim/Expenso)](https://github.com/IkennaEgwim/Expenso/issues) GitHub issues, adapting to changing requirements and feedback iteratively. 
<br>

- Vision 3: Working software over comprehensive documentation: I achieved **15 story points** across **1 sprint**, emphasizing the focus on delivering functional software increments.

## Database Design:

![ERD](./expenso_app/static/readme_img/features/model%20databases.png)


Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help the developer to make connections between databases and information. Creating an ERD helped me understand how the tables relate to one another. I used LucidChart to create the diagram and the arrow represent how the data fields relate to one another.


## Data Models:


| User   |            |   |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| id |  Autofield |  PK|
| username |  CharField   |   FK |
| email | EmailField |     |
| password |  CharField | FK |




| Expense   |            |   |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
|id |  Autofield |  PK |
| user |  CharField   |   FK |
| amount |  DecimalField   |    |
| description | CharField |    |
| date |  DateTimeField   |    |
| category |  CharField | FK |

| Category   |            |   |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
|id |  Autofield |  PK |
| user |  CharField   |   FK |
| name |  CharField   |    |


| Budget  |            |   |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
|id |  Autofield |  PK |
| user |  CharField   |   FK |
| category |  CharField | FK  |
| amount |  DecimalField  |    |
| month |  CharField  |    |




## User Flow Chart:
![Expenso Flowchart](./expenso_app/static/images/flow_chart.png)



The Flowchart served as an efficient way to make important decisions when creating the app. It helped me narrow down which decisions were important for the users and admin as well as establishing the appropriate authentication. It also helped me decide which features were the most important.

<h2 id="deployment-process">Deployment Process</h2>

The deployment process for Tasktopia involved several steps to ensure that the application is running smoothly on a live server. Here's an overview of the steps I followed:

1. **Preparing the Environment:**

   - Ensured that all necessary dependencies were listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
   - Set up environment variables for sensitive information like database credentials and API keys.

2. **Choosing a Hosting Service:**
   - Selected [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for deploying the application due to its ease of use and support for Python applications.
3. **Deploying the Application:**

   - Pushed the code to a GitHub repository.
   - Connected the GitHub repository to Heroku.
   - Configured the Heroku environment with necessary buildpacks and settings.
   - Deployed the application directly from the GitHub repository.

4. **Testing the Live Application:**
   - Conducted thorough testing on the live application to ensure all features were working as expected.
   - Fixed any issues that arose during the live testing phase.

### Deployment via Heroku

Deploying Tasktopia to Heroku was a straightforward and efficient process. Here’s a brief overview of the steps I followed:

1. **Create a Heroku Account:**

   - I signed up for a Heroku account at [Heroku's website](https://www.heroku.com/).

2. **Install Heroku CLI:**

   - I installed the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI) on my local machine to manage the deployment process.

3. **Prepare the Application for Heroku:**

   - Added a `Procfile` to specify the commands Heroku should run to start the application.
   - Included `requirements.txt` and `runtime.txt` files to specify dependencies and the Python version.

4. **Deploy the Application:**

   - Logged into Heroku using the CLI: `heroku login`
   - Created a new Heroku app: `heroku create`
   - Pushed the code to Heroku: `git push heroku main`
   - Configured environment variables via the Heroku dashboard or CLI.

5. **Monitor and Manage:**
   - Used the Heroku dashboard to monitor the application’s performance and logs.
   - Made necessary adjustments to ensure the application runs smoothly on the live server.
