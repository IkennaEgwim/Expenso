## Project Management and Development Approach:

This project was implemented using the Agile Manifesto methodology. Below are the ways this project adhered to the 4 core values and 12 core principles of the aforementioned method:

<strong>Four Values of the Agile Manifesto:</strong>

- Vision 1: Customer collaboration over contract negotiation: I worked with four(4) cohort mates who are my imaginary customers. We held **10** meetings through Google Meet Platform, ensuring alignment with user needs and prioritizing features through user story mapping.
<br>

- Vision 2: Responding to change over following a plan: Throughout the project, I managed
  [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/IkennaEgwim/Expenso)](https://github.com/IkennaEgwim/Expenso/issues) + [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/IkennaEgwim/Expenso)](https://github.com/IkennaEgwim/Expenso/issues) GitHub issues, adapting to changing requirements and feedback iteratively.
<br>

- Vision 3: Working software over comprehensive documentation: I achieved **15 story points** across **1 sprint**, emphasizing the focus on delivering functional software increments.
<br>

<img src="./expenso_app/static/images/UserStories_Issues.png" alt="Screenshot of the team's huddle" width="600" height="100%">

<br>
- Vision 4: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools: Daily interactions on GitHub led to over **65 commits**, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members.
<br>

<strong>Twelve Principles of the Agile Manifesto</strong>

- Satisfy the customer: Held regular meetings to ensure alignment with user stories.
- Deliver working software: Prioritized delivering functional increments in each sprint, allowing for early feedback.
- Welcome changing requirements: Maintained open communication channels and adapted plans iteratively.
- Collaborate daily: Conducted daily standup, catchup and stand-down to facilitate collaboration and problem-solving.
- Face-to-face conversation: Utilized over 15 virtual meetings through slack huddle to enhance clarity and understanding.
- Motivated individuals: Empowered team members through skill development and recognition.
- Measure progress through working product: Evaluated progress based on delivered functionality in each sprint.
- Promote sustainable development: Prioritized sustainability practices to ensure long-term success.
- Simplicity is essential: Used MoSCoW prioritization and focused on MVP delivery to avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence: Adopted show and tell technique to ensure all team members learn while collaborating.
- Self-organizing team: Encouraged autonomy and collaboration within the team.
- Regular reflection on continuous improvement: Conducted regular retrospectives to identify areas for improvement.

# Design Choices:

## Colour scheme:

#fafafa - Header

Dark Green - Buttons

#809977 - Footer

The colours were selected with the intention of complementing the hero image and the idea was to ensure the image was appreciated.

## Typography:
 The following fonts were chosen for a clean and modern look that is both readable and minimal.

Varta

Goudy Book Letter 1911


## Priority Features:

### Home Page:

#### Navbar & Hero Image:
![home](https://github.com/hiboibrahim/thebookbooth1/assets/144109298/4f033ade-4485-40c2-ac2d-5fc5641b5cb7)

The landing page provides an introduction to the website with a call to action button encouraging new users to sign up. Signing up and logging in allows them access to view the available books and to add a book to the collection.
The navigation bar is valuable for users as it provides quick and easy access to important sections of the website. The navigation bar includes links to Home, Books, Add a Book, Register/Logout and Sign In. Displaying a hero image using graphics are both aesthetic and a nod to the repurposed phone booths that have been transformed into local libraries around the world.


#### Registration:

Registration allows users to view the available books and the relevant book details at The Book Booth library. It allows them to add a book as well as edit and delete their addition to ensure the book collection available is updated regularly. 

![signup](https://github.com/hiboibrahim/thebookbooth1/assets/144109298/0b6b2b83-d426-4e63-805b-09a6dcdde550)



#### Sign In:

![sign-in](https://github.com/hiboibrahim/thebookbooth1/assets/144109298/6a1d9a16-2211-4403-88a1-3ec1b506cef4)


#### Books:

![books](https://github.com/hiboibrahim/thebookbooth1/assets/144109298/54c96d8e-6bc3-403f-a8ad-1c4188b60a6e)


#### Add a Book:

![add a book](https://github.com/hiboibrahim/thebookbooth1/assets/144109298/8e15c1d9-193f-4032-b147-0969c3b45bab)


The form allows users to easily add a book to the library which will then be visible on the  books page for the users to browse. Users are also able to edit and delete a book they themselves have added giving them full control over their own contributions.


#### Book Details:

![book detail](https://github.com/hiboibrahim/thebookbooth1/assets/144109298/e88f0274-670b-4a76-8ef8-7c44a5f440a7)

Users are able to find more information about the book they are interested in. The book details include the title, author and a brief summary of the book along with an book cover image. This provides users with sufficient information about the book.

#### Footer:

![footer](https://github.com/hiboibrahim/thebookbooth1/assets/144109298/fde543e6-0ee2-4c17-b8a8-436d4e824f4d)

Links in the footer redirect to respective social media pages. 
It allows users to stay connected with the The Book Booth on social media platforms, keeping them informed about any changes that may occur over time.


# Future Features:

* Implement a review system so readers can share their thoughts about books that they have completed. This will give others a better idea of whether the book is a good fit for them. 
* Display if a book is available with a status (Available, Not Available).
*  Allow users to reserve a book beforehand.
* A search engine where users can search for books by title, author and genre.
* Provide locations of nearest libraries.
* Provide a way for the users to engage and form a secure community.
* Include an about page to inform others of how The Book Booth Library works and how to use it.


Database Design:

![ERD](https://github.com/hiboibrahim/thebookbooth1/assets/144109298/6db92c85-0b4c-485c-b60d-709df3fb963e)


Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help the developer to make connections between databases and information. Creating an ERD helped me understand how the tables relate to one another. I used LucidChart to create the diagram and the arrow represent how the data fields relate to one another.


## Data Models:


| Book   |            |   |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| Title |  CharField |  |
| Author |  CharField   |   FK |
| ISBN | CharField |     |
| User |  CharField | FK |
| Genre |  CharField   |   FK |
| Language | CharField |  FK   |
| Summary |  TextField |  |



| Genre   |            |   |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| Category |  CharField | FK |


| Language   |            |   |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| Language |  CharField | FK  |

| Author  |            |   |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| Name |  CharField | FK  |

## User Flow Chart:
![The Book Booth Flowchart](https://github.com/hiboibrahim/thebookbooth1/assets/144109298/7727f007-8e2e-45fc-b955-57e2d50d1e98)

The Flowchart served as an efficient way to make important decisions when creating the app. It helped me narrow down which decisions were important for the users and admin as well as establishing the appropriate authentication. It also helped me decide which features were the most important i.e adding a book and viewing a list of books that are available to borrow at The Book Booth Library.
